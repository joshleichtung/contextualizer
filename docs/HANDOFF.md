# Contextualizer - BMad Workflow Handoff

**Status**: PRD Complete ‚úÖ ‚Üí Ready for UX Expert & Architect

**Date**: 2025-10-19

---

## What We've Completed

### Comprehensive PRD (docs/prd.md)
- **67 pages** of detailed product requirements
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)** fully specified with 6 epics
- **Progressive roadmap** through Phase 5
- **MCP-first architecture** (conversational interface, real-time tools)
- **AI-first design principles** based on extensive research
- **16 Functional Requirements** (Phase 1) + 27 more (Phases 2-4)
- **25 Non-Functional Requirements** with specific targets
- **Complete epic breakdown** with stories and acceptance criteria
- **User journey examples** demonstrating real-world usage

### Research Foundation
Analyzed 10+ resources including:
- Anthropic docs (Skills, MCP, Memory, Plugins, Subagents, Hooks)
- Inspiration projects (Superpowers, SuperClaude, BMAD v6, AgentOS, Beads, Gitingest)
- Claude Agent SDK patterns and best practices

## Next Steps in BMad Workflow

### 1. UX Expert Review (Sally - @ux-expert)

**Your Task**: Create Front-End Specification

**To Activate**:
```
@ux-expert Please review the PRD at docs/prd.md and create a front-end specification.
Focus on conversational UX design since this is primarily an MCP server with natural
language interface. See the "For UX Expert" section at the end of the PRD for
detailed instructions.
```

**Deliverable**: `docs/frontend-spec.md`

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Conversational UX patterns (how Claude presents MCP tool results)
- CLI installation experience
- Terminal output design (colors, progress indicators)
- Marketplace presence
- Error message tone and clarity

---

### 2. Architect Review (Winston - @architect)

**Your Task**: Create Comprehensive Architecture Document

**To Activate**:
```
@architect Please review the PRD at docs/prd.md and create a full-stack architecture
document. This is a complex MCP server with multiple layers (TypeScript server, bash
hooks, file generation, conflict resolution). See the "For Architect" section at the
end of the PRD for detailed requirements.
```

**Deliverable**: `docs/architecture.md`

**Key Focus Areas**:
- MCP server architecture (tools, resources, prompts)
- Communication flows (Claude ‚Üî MCP ‚Üî File System)
- Component design (preset system, template engine, diagnostics)
- Data architecture (config schema, state management, caching)
- Security model and performance targets
- Testing strategy
- Phase 2-5 extensibility

---

### 3. After Architecture Complete

**PO Agent** will:
1. Run master checklist to validate PRD + Architecture alignment
2. Shard the PRD into epics
3. Shard the Architecture into component specs
4. Prepare for Story Manager to begin development cycle

**Then SM (Story Manager)** will:
1. Draft first story from Epic 1 (MCP Server Foundation)
2. Begin development cycle with Dev agent

## Project Summary for Context

### What is Contextualizer?

An **MCP server and plugin ecosystem** that transforms Claude Code projects into AI-first development environments through:
- **Conversational configuration** (not one-time CLI setup)
- **Real-time diagnostics** (always-available tools during development)
- **Intelligent workflows** (memory, skills, subagents, observability)

### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional "run once" setup tools, Contextualizer operates as an **active development partner** through MCP integration‚ÄîClaude can invoke Contextualizer tools during any conversation to configure, diagnose, optimize, and manage project infrastructure.

### Architecture Highlights

**Primary**: MCP Server (TypeScript/Node.js)
- Tools: `init_project`, `run_doctor`, `configure_hooks`, `manage_memory`, etc.
- Resources: config, diagnostics, presets, best-practices
- Prompts: setup_wizard, health_check, optimize_for_ai

**Secondary**: Plugin wrapper (convenience slash commands)

**Generated Artifacts**: Bash hooks, YAML configs, markdown memory files (zero runtime dependencies)

### Progressive Phases

1. **Phase 1** (8-12 weeks): Foundation - Setup, diagnostics, hooks ‚Üê **WE ARE HERE**
2. **Phase 2** (4-8 weeks): Intelligence - Memory, skills, subagents
3. **Phase 3** (6-10 weeks): Observability - Web/server/mobile introspection
4. **Phase 4** (8-12 weeks): Workflows - Systematic AI development
5. **Phase 5** (Ongoing): Ecosystem - Marketplace, enterprise

## Key Documents

- **PRD**: `docs/prd.md` (67 pages, complete)
- **This Handoff**: `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- **Next**: `docs/frontend-spec.md` (UX Expert)
- **Next**: `docs/architecture.md` (Architect)

## Questions for Agents

### For UX Expert:
- How should we design the conversational experience for conflict resolution?
- What's the optimal format for doctor diagnostics reports?
- Should we implement a custom statusline, and if so, what should it show?

### For Architect:
- How do we ensure idempotent MCP tool operations?
- What's the best caching strategy for best practices and preset templates?
- How do we handle concurrent MCP requests safely?
- What's the plugin API architecture for community extensions?
