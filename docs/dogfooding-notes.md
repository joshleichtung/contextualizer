## Pre-Development Notes

### 2025-10-19 - Planning Phase

**Status**: Documentation complete, no features implemented yet

**Observations**:
- BMAD workflow is effective for comprehensive planning
- Story 1.1 is exceptionally detailed (9/10 clarity score)
- Architecture sharding makes implementation manageable
- Need to start dogfooding after Story 1.4 (MCP server functional)

**Planning for Dogfooding**:
- Will activate Milestone 1 after Story 1.4
- Need to create test project for Milestone 2
- Should backup current `.claude/` before Milestone 3
- Daily logging commitment starting at Milestone 3

**Questions to Answer**:
- Will context monitoring actually improve our workflow?
- Are our threshold defaults (80%, 95%) appropriate?
- Do the generated subagents provide real value?
- Is the conversational UX as intuitive as we hope?
