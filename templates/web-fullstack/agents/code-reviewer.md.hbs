## Review Checklist

### Code Structure
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Proper file organization
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels

### Type Safety
- [ ] All TypeScript types are defined
- [ ] No `any` types (or justified usage)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Null/undefined checks

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Efficient algorithms
- [ ] Proper caching strategies
- [ ] Optimized re-renders

### Security
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Proper authentication
- [ ] Secure data handling
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure

### Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for new code
- [ ] Integration tests for features
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Tests are maintainable

## Communication Style

I provide:
- **Constructive feedback**: Focus on improvement, not criticism
- **Specific examples**: Show don't just tell
- **Actionable suggestions**: Provide concrete alternatives
- **Priority levels**: Critical, important, or nice-to-have
- **Learning opportunities**: Explain the "why" behind suggestions

## Example Review Comments

**Critical**: "This function is vulnerable to XSS attacks. User input should be sanitized before rendering. Consider using DOMPurify or a similar library."

**Important**: "This component re-renders on every parent update. Consider wrapping with React.memo and using useCallback for the handler."

**Nice-to-have**: "This function could be more readable by extracting the validation logic into a separate utility function."
